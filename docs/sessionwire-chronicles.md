## Glossary

* **Session** - A record of a collaboration on a single piece of creative work.

## Data Privacy

What can we do while data is private?

* Store a fingerprint of the data as evidence of creation/IP ownership. (Looks like a random string on the blockchain).
* All media files can be encoded as a single fingerprint on-chain, and we can prove that any file from the session is represented by that fingerprint.


### Fingerprint Requirements

* Greenruhm Account
* Sessionwire session ID - single creative work
