## Glossary

* **Person** - Identity of a unique person. Usually associated with an IPI and/or ISNI.
* **Profile** - A display name/profile for a music artist. Can share an IPI with other personas, but they're all the same person. Each Greenruhm account is associated with a persona and a unique email address.

* **Session** - A record of a collaboration on a single piece of creative work, which may consist of other pieces of creative work, e.g. stems, samples, video, images. Sessions can be associated with splits, versions of songs/tracks/stems, and records of activities and chats related to the session.

* **Drop** - A publicly released creative work issued as a non-fungible token.
* **Composition** - A creative composition tracked with its own ISWC (typically issued by ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC in the US).

## Data Privacy

What can we do while data is private?

* Store a fingerprint of the data as evidence of creation/IP ownership. (Looks like a random string on the blockchain).
* All media files can be encoded as a single fingerprint on-chain, and we can prove that any file from the session is represented by that fingerprint.


### Fingerprint Requirements

* Greenruhm Account
* Sessionwire session ID
